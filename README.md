 Python Programming: Day 3 - Advanced Exercises

Welcome to Day 3 of Python programming This session focuses on complex problems that involve matrix operations, string manipulation, and file handling. 

Exercises

1. Matrix Multiplication
Multiply two matrices and return the result. Ensure that the dimensions of the matrices are valid for multiplication.


- Two matrices represented as 2D lists.
- Output:
- A 2D list representing the resulting matrix or an error message.
python
A = [[1, 2], [3, 4]]
B = [[5, 6], [7, 8]]
print(matrix_multiplication(A, B))
